# cat-api
This project consumes the free resources of https://thecatapi.com/

# Dependencies
In this project I have implemented the use of cocoapods, such as:
- Alamofire.
- ObjectMapper.
- SVProgress.

# To be considered
When you start the app, a request is made to the public API for 20 cat breeds
and from this data you can interact with the app by voting for the breed you like the most.

To learn more about this API consult https://docs.thecatapi.com/
